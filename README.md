# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

// PROGRAMMER CREATED README

### TRIAD TRAVEL - REACT CLASS ECOMMERCE MODEL
This project was created using React. I did not use Vite based on some early issues with instalation. 

This project additionally uses:
- React Router Dom
- Firebase
- Bootstrap
- React Bootstrap
- Bootstrap icons
- Sweet Alerts 2

### FILE STRUCTURE
I attempted to separate out the main function pages as a category, data (this was less needed as I shifted to Firebase data), and pages that were not the item list container or detail into a separate category (currently only checkout related, I would like to add more pages including a login and about me in the future). Note that page-specific CSS style pages are alongside their respective page, while a general style CSS that applies to the full application is in a separate section.

### VISUAL
I went with a minimalist style that heavily uses existing style from Bootstrap. I have a "dark mode" as the only and default setting. At some point in the future I will make the page design responsive.

### CALL OUTS
I spent quite a bit of time with the HandleSearch component, allowing users to search a variety of terms to find the best results.

### NEXT STEPS
While this project is a good example of tools/methods learned in this class, I'd like to improve and add functions before adding to my portfolio:
- Make page design responsive
- Add a login feature
- Add location-based discounts
- Add country location API
- Add dates as part of the purchasing process
